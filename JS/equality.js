'use strict';

const age = 18;

//if age is exactly 18, we use ===

/*
    === (Strict Equal) doesnt perform type coercion.
        returns T/F. T => when both sides are exactly the same else F
    
    == (Loose Equal) Does Type coercion internally.

    Eg. 
    '18' == 18  ==> returns true reason being type coercison
    '18' === 18 ==> returns false
